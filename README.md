# Password Generator Starter Code
This code is created to make a password generator. 
A password generator creates and gives you a random password.

I started by editing the HTML and adding the requirements for the password as a label.
I added that the password must be a minimun of 8 characters and no more than 128.
I added that the password must include atleast one uppercase, one number and one special character.

I declared approriate variables needed for my code to respond to.

Then I moved to the javascript file and made some changes to that.
I first started by making sure my generated button was clickable.
I then put some code on the javascript file to make sure that the requirements for the password were met and if it does not meet password requirements a message of
"does not meet password requirements" will show on the screen.
I created an if else statement for the password requirements.



Lastly, I made a new repo throught github and made sure my code was viewable and accessible
through my repo github.
